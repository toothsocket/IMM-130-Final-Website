The Big Idea: Concept, User Personas, and User Stories
		I want to create an electronic store-front for crochet projects that is styled like an 8-bit game and mimicking 90s and early 2000s websites whilst still being dynamic and functional for today’s modern website standards. The website is a portfolio at the moment, as ecommerce is outside of the scope of this class, but I hope it will showcase everything I’ve learned thus far. I wanted to create a very pink website to showcase how beautiful stereotypical femininity can be. There is a huge stigma around “Girly Girls”, and I wanted to show that it is such a beautiful thing. I want my website to be inclusive for anyone who wants to celebrate stereotypical femininity, even if they are not themselves. This website will attract a variety of user types with different user stories. 
	I want my users to be able to shop on an aesthetically pleasing website and find any of the products they need. As this is just a portfolio right now, I hope that the users will be able to see my work and use the “Contact Me” form if they have any questions. 
 Target Audience:
	My website’s target audience is very wide. It is mostly aimed towards people with female body types, as I create primarily clothing based on my own anatomy. But anyone can wear the clothing, as I make it size inclusive for the female body type. So, in general the target audience is women and female-presenting non-binary people. Plushies are generally bought by women and non-binary people or children, so they’re going to be the target audience of the stuffed animals. The target audience will access the website through advertisement. A lot of crochet sellings tend to have booths at craft fairs, social media advertisements, and business cards that have a link or QR code to their website, and I hope to do the same. Customers will be able to access the website on their phones and computers, as it will adapt to both platforms.
Typography:
	My website uses primarily two Google fonts, called Pixelify Sans and Courier Sans. Pixelify Sans is used mostly for headings and titles, and Courier Sans is used for body text. I used these fonts because they went along very well with the early 90s and 2000s aesthetics without being too hard to read, so it is still accessible to all users. They very much convey the cute, pinkie 8-bit aesthetic of the site. 
Composition and Layout:
	I chose to visually organize my content in a typical reading from top to bottom, left to right fashion. However, all the pages have the “lang” tag implemented so electronic website translators can recognize and translate the language. Most things are centered on the page, and it looks similar to most ecommerce sites, with grids of products for sale. Every page has a copyright on the bottom left corner. The images are very big as the products are what I want to be featured the most on the site. The website works on both web and mobile devices (it is dynamic), but was originally coded for web. 
Images:
	I want to make it abundantly clear that the images on the site, excluding the headshot of myself, are NOT MY IMAGES. At the end of this document, I have credited the source for all of my images, most of which were posted to Pinterest or created with DALL-E, an AI image generator. I did not have enough images of my own crochet work to use, as crochet projects take a lot of time, however my site is set up so that once I do have images of my own work, it can easily switch out my images for those on the site. Images are a primary focus of this site, so they are used on almost every page to promote products. They are normally displayed in grids. The images themselves are the content of the site. Since I am using a lot of images, I had to compress them using TinyPng.com I also have made an image the background of most of my headings. This image is a 90s Windows Tab, to mimic that old technology feel. 

Design Principles:
	My site employs a lot of the design principles that we have used throughout the year. As discussed before, my site employs beautiful typography and repetition to make the site cohesive and on theme. The site has dominance as the large fonts and very flashy colors make it enticing for users to use. Since my site is similar to other ecommerce sites, it is easier for users to navigate through, giving it similarity. My content on each page has a natural flow, and so I believe this gives it rhythm. It also has the same natural flow on each page. My site does not employ a lot of texture, as this conflicts with the 90s and 2000s vibe I was going for (there were textured sites during that time period, but I felt as though the textured look was not nice to look at and made the website harder to use).  But, most content items have a border around them to make them stick out and become more cohesive with the background, which is a slight pink gradient. My site uses a navigation bar located at the top of the screen that sticks to the top of the screen even when scrolling, which highlights its existence to the user. The user will logically use the navigation bar to enter new pages. I believe my site has a logical progression from page to page. As for contrast, my site uses a lot of pink, so creating contrast was hard. But, I think my use of different shades of pink allows for the content to stick out. Overall, these design principles make the website easier to navigate, aesthetically pleasing and nostalgic, and draws the attention of new users to my site. 

Colors:
	Three Words: Pink, pink, and more pink. I was going for a very stereotypical feminine feel. I love the use of pastel pinks and darker pinks to really drive the femininity home. It suits the users as my target audience as stated previously is mostly feminine people and children, two groups of people who love bright, pastel colors and pinks. It really suits the project as I really wanted to create something that promoted femininity. 

Javascript/Interactivity:
	I have used two Javascript instances in my site. One of which is a fotorama, which was a very easy insertion that I took from JQuery. My more significant Javascript project was the plush toy personality quiz pop up. When you click the button, it opens a quiz that the user can take to find out which plush toy matches them best. The quiz is fully stylized. The quiz will also give the user a result once they finish the quiz. As a computer science major, this seemed so interesting to me, and I wanted to create a java script code that could actually pair the quiz answers to the result, and just spit out a random one if for some reason this fails. After much google searching, I was unable to fully implement the connection of the answers to the results. Right now the quiz supports a random allocation of answers to the result, but I left my attempt at the logic in my site, so you may see where it could be with more Javascript practice. I found the code for this on the internet, and tried to adapt it to my specific website, but it does not seem to be having the same effect. But, with more experience, I do very much think I could make this fully functioning. 

User Testing and Usability: 
	I took into account the suggested revisions from our partner user testing exercise to make the website more user friendly and easier to navigate. I received a lot of feedback about the usability of my site, so hopefully the updated site map allows for easier navigation as well. I think my website will be memorable and connect with users because of my personal touch that I included on the home page. I hope to help people who want cute clothes and stuffed animals to have a space where this is celebrated.
